## About iCarpe Diem - Bucketlist Application
iCarpeDiem is an application that allows individuals to create a “Bucketlist”. The user's bucketlist is a list of items that the user wants to accomplish before they die. Once a user signs up, and then signs in, they can create, update, and remove list items. Each list item is required to have a description, category, and status. Immediately upon signing in, the application retrieves all that user’s list items and displays them to the user.

## Project Planning & Develeopment Process

Before writing any code, I made sure to enagage in a thorough planning process. I sketched out an initial set of wireframes and wrote some basic user stories. I then determined which relationships that I wanted to exist in my app and documented them in an ERD. I then determined the order that I wanted to complete sections of the project in. I knew that first I wanted to set up my project API. Once I could get my API functioning correctly, I then would create a very basic front-end in my client repository. Then, I would ensure that the front-end could properly connect to the back end. Once that was completed, I would work to create a more sophisticated user interface with Boostrap.


## Unsolved Issues
-   I wanted to incorporate a bootstrap carousel of images on the home page but did not have time to perfect it. The carousel would have had pictures of people completing bucketlist items (ex. skydiving, snorkeling, etc.). I had issues with displaying images at a consistent size without distortion. That is something that I would like to add to a future iteration.
-   I also wanted to eventually give users the ability to add upload images associated with each Bucketlist item but was unable to incorporate that within the time constraints.
